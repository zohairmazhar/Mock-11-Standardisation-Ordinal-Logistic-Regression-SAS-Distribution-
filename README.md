In this project we perform a mock 11+ test standardisation in R by modelling the relationship between pupil age and raw scores using an ordinal logistic regression model fitted to the main testing cohort. Standardised Age Scores (SAS) are derived from this model for both main and late testers using cumulative probabilities mapped onto the theoretical N(100,15) distribution,
and checked for consistency across testing sessions.
