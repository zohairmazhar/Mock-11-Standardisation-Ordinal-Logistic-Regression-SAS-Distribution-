In this project we perform a mock 11+ test standardisation in R by modelling the relationship between pupil age and raw scores using ordinal logistic regression fitted to the main testing cohort. Standardised Age Scores (SAS) are derived from this model for both main and late testers using cumulative probabilities, evaluated against the theoretical N(100,15) distribution,
and checked for consistency across testing sessions.
